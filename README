S = SYN Bit: Needed to establish a new connection. SEQ containts a start ID
A = ACK Bit:
	SYN+ACK: needed as response to the SYN establish request. Return value should be SYN ID + 1
	ACK: Reply to the sender and acknowledge the received paket
	
	
If handshake is done successfully, a connection is established.

N = NULL Segment: sent to signal that the other end is still alive.
	NULL + ACK as respone - otherwise the connection is marked as timed out
	
	
C = Checksum: CRC Checksum
	C = 0: checksum of header
	C = 1: checksum of header + data
	
Retransmit
==========

If no ACK packet is received, after 600 msec the packet is retransmited.
If there is still no ACK - the connection is marked as broken.
No other packages will be send any more

Data
====

The header has fixed length. So the beginning of the data block is always the same
